# Landing page for team TSMP
This would be the landing page for the highest level teams within the organisation

This team has nested teams. The teams have a webpage in the GitHub structure
- [model-dev](https://github.com/orgs/test-dcv/teams/model-dev)
- [configurators](https://github.com/orgs/test-dcv/teams/configurators)

and within their webpage, it is possible to find the associated repositories, for example, the [repos handled by model-dev](https://github.com/orgs/test-dcv/teams/model-dev/repositories)

It seems unnecessary therefore to create `md` files for every nested team. In this landing page it makes sense to explain the overall structure and relationship between the teams and repos belonging to TSMP.
